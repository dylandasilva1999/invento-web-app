<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description

According to Kincaid diving into the history of Minecraft, it was initially created in 2009 by Markus Persson, was "...also known as Notch and was originally called Cave Game" (2019). Minecraft then evolved into a "survival game", where you have to "...survive hostile mobs and can explore the vast world" and use your "...resources to craft new materials that you can use to create structures, survive longer, and craft more materials" (Kincaid 2019). This is where the basis of the project comes from to manage and keep track of those resources and which recipes can be crafted.

Invento is a specified interactive web application `Minecraft` inventory tracker for those crafter enthusiasts, who want to bring their game to another level, enhancing their technical capabilities with ease.

Invento is a project for my Term 2 Interactive Development major, where we were tasked to create an interactive web application using C# and MVC architecture that will act as a Minecraft inventory tracker. I then created a brand and logo for my project called Invento, to tie in with the inventory management system, and made use a cube logo to represent the main logo of minecraft.
